# ConferenceManager
Platform for creating and managing conferences (speakers, sessions, schedules, etc.)

## Initial Application Setup: the TODO list
This is the initial set of tasks that I will be doing to get the project up and running.  
Once these are done, I'll start tracking features/tasks in GitHub Issues.  
Maybe even make a GitHub Project if I'm feeling up to it.

- [x] Create initial repository
- [x] Initialize Cucumber.js
  - [x] Write some initial feature specs
  - [x] Create some test plumbing to make it easier to wire up the test code
- [ ] Create the API project
  - [ ] Make a status endpoint to validate that the API can be reached and is up
- [ ] Create the UI project
  - [ ] Validate the UI can talk to the API (via the status endpoint)
- [ ] Feature: New User Registration
- [ ] Feature: Login page
- [ ] Feature: Create new event
- [ ] Feature: Submit session
